Speaker Notes for the 2018-01-11 Software Carpentry git lesson

**TYPE ALL EXAMPLES AS YOU GO. THIS KEEPS THE SPEED SANE, AND ALLOWS YOU TO EXPLAIN EVERY STEP.**

**START SLIDES WITH `reveal-md slides.md --theme=white`**

## Version control with `git`

**SLIDE** (Version control with `git`)

* Build good software engineering **habits** (needs repetition and practice)
* **Transferable skill**: what's good for software also good for other documents

**SLIDE** (Etherpad)

* Share code snippets
* Ask/answer questions
* Communal note-taking

**SLIDE** (Let me tell you a story)

**SLIDE** (Once upon a time)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Advantage of version control)

* Talk around slide
* credit and blame?

**SLIDE** (Version control with `git`)

**SLIDE** (What lies ahead)

* Talk around slide
* Who has used `git`
* Who has heard about `git` but not used it?
* Who's heard horror stories about `git`?
* `git` actually elegant and powerful - some truth in jokes, though
* SWC focus more on *version control*, just that `git` is the tool we're using

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Do you recognise this?)

* Talk around slide

* **Things get much more complicated when more people are involved**

* **Ask the audience**
  * Who has been in that situation?
  * Fundamental problems:
    * synchronising changes
    * tracking change times
  * How do you get round it?
  * MS Office: track changes
  * Office 365: simultaneous edits?
  * DropBox: now locks files in use
  * Google Docs: simultaneous editing - but for code?
  
* **Version control systems are a solution to this**
  * Excellent for code
  * Useful for most activities

* **How version control works**
  * Keeps only one document
  * Saves records of all changes made to the document
  * Who made the changes, and when
  * Can reconstruct the entire editing history
  * Works most efficiently with text-based documents
    * e.g. CSV, code, scripts, Markdown 
    * Not so called 'binary' files like .docx, images or compressed files. 
  
**SLIDE** (How version control works)

* Talk around slide
* **for mathematicians!**
  * can treat original document as a value (d)
  * changes are then functions, acting on that value, e.g. f(d)
  * functions can be compounded: g(f(d))
* **draw on whiteboard?**

**SLIDE** (Multiple editors - branching)

* Talk around slide
* **for mathematicians**
  * f(d) != g(d) 

**SLIDE** (Combining changes - merging)

* Talk around slide
* **for mathematicians**
  * h(f(d), g(d))

**SLIDE** (What version control systems do)

* Talk around slide
* *commits* are not exactly *changes* - more like checkpoints


## Setting up `git`

**SLIDE** (Setting up `git`)

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Setting global options)

* Talk around slide

* **`git` command structure**
  * `git <command> <options>`
  *  i.e. `git` **verb** *options*
  * The name and email address will be associated with all our actions in `git`
  * It's helpful to have some colour to interpret `git` output
  * The `--global` flag means that every project on the computer will see these settings
  
* **Use your own name and email address!**

```
lpritc@Totoro:~$ git config --global user.name "Leighton Pritchard"
lpritc@Totoro:~$ git config --global user.email "leighton.pritchard@hutton.ac.uk"
lpritc@Totoro:~$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
lpritc@Totoro:~$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
(git config --global core.editor "'C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe' \
                                 -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin")
```

* **Check settings at any time**
  * You can reset these settings at any point
  * check with `git config --list`
  
```
lpritc@Totoro:~$ git config --list
user.name=Leighton Pritchard
user.email=leighton.pritchard@hutton.ac.uk
push.default=simple
color.ui=auto
core.editor=emacs
```

## Creating a repository

**SLIDE** (Creating a repository)

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Creating a `git` repository)

* Talk around slide

* **Create a new directory to hold the project**
  * Create it somewhere convenient for you

```
lpritc@Totoro:~$ cd
lpritc@Totoro:~$ mkdir planets
lpritc@Totoro:~$ cd planets
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ 
```

  * point out that we are in `planets` - maybe do an `ls`

* **Make this directory a repository**

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/lpritc/planets/.git/
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ ls
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ ls -a
./    ../   .git/
```

  * Nothing appears to have changed, at first
  * Using `ls -a` shows the hidden `.git` subdirectory
  * All information about the repository is stored in this subdirectory


* **Check all is well**
  * Get a report on repository status
  * We have not added or committed any files, so we get this statement
  * Describe `master` branch - default
  
```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

## Tracking changes

**SLIDE** (Tracking changes)

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* Talk around slide

### My first `git` commit

**SLIDE** (My first untracked file)

* Talk around slide

* **Create a file**
  * We'll be discussing Mars' suitability as a base
  * Add some suitable text and save the file
  
```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ nano mars.txt
Cold and dry. Everything a nice colour. Matt Damon.
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ ls
mars.txt
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ cat mars.txt
Cold and dry. Everything a nice colour. Matt Damon.
```

  * We now have a single file in this directory


* **Check repository status**
  * Use `git status` to see what `git` thinks.
  
```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

  * It has noticed that the file exists
  * Git says it is not 'tracking' the file - i.e. not recording changes

  
**SLIDE** (My first `git` commit)

* Talk around slide

* **Tell `git` to track the file**

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git add mars.txt 
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   mars.txt
#
``` 

  * Git sees the new file as a 'change' that is not yet committed
  * The changes are **STAGED**


* **Commit the file to the repository**
  * Commiting the change to the repository stores it
  * We add a message to keep notes on changes
    * short (<50 char) imperative one-liner
    * details in a second text block
  * We commit *all* current changes simultaneously
  * Note the short identifier for this commit

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
[master (root-commit) d22195b] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

* **Use `git log` to see the history**
  * `git log` shows commits in reverse chronological order
  * Note the full identifier for this commit
  * The log message is also included
  * Only the file exists in the current working directory - all the log information etc. is in `.git`
  

```

**SLIDE** (The staging area)

* Talk around slide

### modify-add-commit

**SLIDE** (modify-add-commit)

* Talk around slide

* **Make some changes to the file**

```

#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

  * `git` tracks `mars.txt` so sees the changes are made
  * Changed file is "not staged for commit"


* **Inspect changes since last commit**
  * `git diff` notes differences between the current version of the file in the working directory, and the latest in the repository
  
```

```

  * Line 1: output is similar to `diff` command
  * Line 2: unique identifiers for files being compared
  * Lines 3,4: which versions are compared (a: repo; b: directory)
  * The rest of the lines show what the differences are between the files (-: lines removed; +: lines added)

* **Commit the change**
  * `git` won't let us commit without staging (with `git add`)
  * We don't always want to commit all changes to all files at the same time

## Restoring older versions

**SLIDE** (Restoring older versions)

* Talk around slide

* **Accidentally overwrite a file**

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ nano mars.txt 
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ cat mars.txt
POTATOES!
```
  * Once overwritten, `git status` says the changes were made, but not staged.

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

* **Restore the last commit**
  * Use `git checkout HEAD`
  * No file named: `git` warns you
  * Name the file, `git` thinks you mean it!
  
```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt 
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ cat mars.txt 
Cold and dry. Everything a nice colour. Matt Damon.
Two moons. This may be an issue for werewolves!
Not much atmosphere, mind.
A bit dusty. Bring a Hoover.
```

**SLIDE** (`git checkout`)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Question)

Solution: 2 & 4

1. will not overwrite (will warn)
2. solution
3. will overwrite `data-cruncher.py` with the change before last
4. solution

## Ignoring things

**SLIDE** (Ignoring things)

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* Talk around slide
* **Ask the audience** - which files would you ignore?

**SLIDE** (Not all files are useful)

* Talk around slide

* **Create dummy files**
  * Create dummy files and subdirectory

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ mkdir results
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ ls
a.dat      b.dat      c.dat      earth.txt  mars.txt   results/
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ ls results/
a.out  b.out
```

  * These files are no use to us
  * `git` says they're not being tracked
  * `git` doesn't tell us about contents of untracked directories

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	a.dat
#	b.dat
#	c.dat
#	results/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**SLIDE** (`.gitignore`)

* Talk around slide

* **Create `.gitignore` file**
  * Two patterns: `*.dat`, `results/` (all files below this point)
  
```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ nano .gitignore
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ cat .gitignore 
# Exclude all files ending in .dat
*.dat
# Exclude all files below results/
results/
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	.gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

  * `git` now ignores the new files, but notices `.gitignore`


* **Commit `.gitignore`**

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git add .gitignore 
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git commit -m "add .gitignore file"
[master f0232b1] Added .gitignore file
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

* **List ignored files**

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git status --ignored
# On branch master
# Ignored files:
#   (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	a.dat
#	b.dat
#	c.dat
#	results/
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

* **Add an ignored file**
  * `git` will refuse
  * Can override with `-f`, `--force`

```
lpritc@Totoro:planets$ git add b.dat
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
b.dat
Use -f if you really want to add them.
fatal: no files added
```

## GitHub collaboration

**SLIDE** (GitHub collaboration)

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* Talk around slide
* It's fine to use GitHub/other remote hosts as a personal store (even a private store)
* At some point you may want/need to collaborate - and this is requires a few more skills

**SLIDE** (Starting a collaboration)

* **Pair off learners**

* **Demonstrate giving a colleague access**
  * `Settings -> Collaborators` - add your partner's username/ID
  * `cd` to a new directory (e.g. `tmp/`)
  * clone *your colleague's* repo
  * Check the remote repo location with `git remote -v`

## Resolving `git` conflicts

**SLIDE** (Resolving `git` conflicts)

**SLIDE** (Learning objectives)

* What do I do when my changes conflict with someone else’s?
* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Why conflicts occur)

* Talk around slide

* **`git` encourages particular ways of working**
  * modular structure - small files (reusability)
  * small, incremental changes (reproducibility)
  * commits should pass all tests!
  * good planning
  * interaction/communication

**SLIDE** (Seriously, `git push` when done)
  
**SLIDE** (Let's make a conflict)

* Talk around the slide

* **Create the owner conflict**
  * Check you're in the right repo
  * Add a line to `mars.txt`
  * Commit and push

To https://github.com/widdowquinn/planets.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/widdowquinn/planets.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

**SLIDE** (The conflict message)

* Talk around the slide
* local conflicts with remote, so you cannot push!
* advice from `git`: integrate remote with `git pull` before `push`ing again.

**SLIDE** (The conflicting changes)

* Talk around the slide
* **COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVELOPERS**

## Resolving a conflict

**SLIDE** (Resolving a conflict)

* Talk around slide

* **Pull the remote changes**
  * `git` tries to merge automatically, and will if it can
  * If not, it marks the conflict in the affected file
  * `git` tells us about the problem

```
bash-3.2$ git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 3 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/widdowquinn/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
   a416b49..9d2082c  master     -> origin/master
Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

* **Explain conflict syntax**
  * The local change in `HEAD` is preceded by `<<<<<<<`
  * Then there's a separator `=========`
  * Then the remote change, followed by `>>>>>>>`
  * We have to decide which change to keep (if either)

```
bash-3.2$ cat mars.txt

* **Edit the file to resolve the change**
  * Until you add/commit, `git status` will warn about "unmerged paths"
